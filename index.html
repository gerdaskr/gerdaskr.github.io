    <h1 class="iconicimg">ICONIC IMAGERY</h1>
    <p>“Iconic” is a term that has quite drastically changed its meaning over time. In the past, “icon” most often referred to pictures of saints displayed in churches. Nowadays, however, the term is incredibly broad, and can point to anything recognizable and influential in culture - iconic fashion, iconic brands or personalities, iconic speeches, iconic architecture, iconic performances, iconic images and even iconic movie scenes.
        <br>
        <br> What peaks my interest is how iconic imagery can be classified into two distinct categories - fictional and historical - and what is the difference of our perception and understanding between them.
        <br>
        <br> To explore this question I have taken a look at a historical event captured in an iconic photograph, as well as an iconic movie scene from Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction” side by side. Both are influential in their own ways, and immediately recognizable to anyone who has seen them at least once before - to prove my point, I have recreated both the photograph and the movie scene as CSS animation scenes from slightly different angles than the originals. Despite the stylization and perspective change, the imagery is still familiar, and forces the viewer to recall any associations that they may have with the actual photograph or movie scene.</p>

            <p>Photograph taken by Jeff Widener in 1989, China, a day after the Tiananmen Square massacre. The picture shows a man with shopping bags that has stopped in front of an approaching line of tanks and is refusing to move from their path. Regarded as "a symbol of resistance to unjust regimes everywhere."</p>

            <p>A famous scene from Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" (1994), often referenced in regard to the director's quite liberal use of violence and gore in his movies. The scene shows three characters conversating in the car, when suddenly one of them accidentally shoots another one in the head, resulting in a chaotic scramble to get off the street.</p>
